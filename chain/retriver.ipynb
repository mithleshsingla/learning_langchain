However, the guid-\\nance of flow matching is more general than and\\nthus substantially different from that of its prede-\\ncessor, diffusion models. Therefore, the challenge\\nin guidance for general flow matching remains\\nlargely underexplored. In this paper, we propose\\nthe first framework of general guidance for flow\\nmatching. From this framework, we derive a fam-\\nily of guidance techniques that can be applied\\nto general flow matching. These include a new\\ntraining-free asymptotically exact guidance, novel\\ntraining losses for training-based guidance, and\\ntwo classes of approximate guidance that cover\\nclassical gradient guidance methods as special\\ncases. We theoretically investigate these different')],\n",
